# Hi, I'm Trea 🌻💖

I'm currently at [The Data School](https://www.thedataschool.co.uk/) with [The Information Lab](https://www.theinformationlab.co.uk/), where I’m working with data to tell clear, meaningful stories.

Along the way, I’ve found myself interested in data engineering - from the behind-the-scenes pipelines to building things that make data more usable and reliable. I'm enjoying getting hands-on with the more technical side of things and seeing how it all fits together!

I’m using this to share small projects and keep track of what I’m learning. It’s a bit of a mix of lots of bits at the moment, but I’ll be adding more as I go!

Thanks for visiting 👩🏻‍💻
